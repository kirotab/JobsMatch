JobsMatch
=========

JobsMatch is an application that helps with matching of personal skill set and job
offers in the largest bulgarian career site.
This is a windows 8 store application written in C# and xaml, the main idea behind it is to save time 
allowing some filtering before you open the job offer.

The app is not completely finished as it was part of educational course and there were only 4-5 days to complete it.

Future plans include html parsing in a web service, not on the client which will save lots of internet traffic,
maintaining databse with offers which will allow analysis and statistical information that can be very helpful 
for users or job offerers :)
